# SML_LFC_Project
Code for implementations of the SML-Project on "Learning from Crowds"

run data_screening.r first to simulate fresh annotations
running raykar_binary_classification.r fits the model using EM-algorithm and displays estimates/predictions/misclassifications at the end
running logistic_regression_binary_classification.r fits simple logistic regression models on majority + ground truth and displays predictions/misclassifications at the end
